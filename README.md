# Welcome to Glyphr Studio!

## Beta 5 has been released!
Just in time for the 2014 holiday season, Glyphr Beta 5 was released!  Major new features are Importing and Exporting SVG Fonts, Ligatures, and Kerning.  Lots of little features, too – a full breakdown of new features can be found at [the Glyphr Studio Blog](http://www.glyphrstudio.com/blog) or at the [Beta 5 GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/mattlag/Glyphr-Studio/releases/tag/v0.5.0).

And just in time for New Year's Day, Beta 5.1 was released - with bug fixes, performance enhancements, and a new Pen Tool!

Beta 5.2 is just some bug fixes, which is kind of boring, but necessary.

As always, there is kind of a running list of feature ideas over at the [Issues List]( https://github.com/mattlag/Glyphr-Studio/issues?labels=&page=1&state=open).

## New features to come as Version 1 is on the way!
There will be many new features in Version 1! Currently we are integrating with OpenType.js to support OTF and TTF import and export.

With Version 1, we will also be enabling Components (which will be replacing Linked Shapes). Components are collections of shapes that can be re-used across characters, but also transformed individually.

## Contributing & Feedback
I'm an interaction designer by trade, and have decided to use Glyphr Studio as a giant crash course in JavaScript and HTML5.  Since this is my first major HTML5/JS app, there are many opportunities for growth & improvement - for both code, and collaborative development styles.

If you’d like to contribute a feature or bug fix, please make sure to search the issue tracker first, your issue may have already been discussed or fixed in master.  After researching, please feel free to fork and send a pull request.
