# Welcome to Glyphr Studio!
Glyphr Studio is a free, web based font editor, focusing on font design hobbyists.  
More information can be found at [glyphrstudio.com](http://glyphrstudio.com) - and/or follow [@glyphrstudio](https://twitter.com/glyphrstudio) on twitter.

## Beta 4 is out!
On the Fourth of July, Glyphr Studio Beta 4 was released!  Major new features are Importing SVG Outlines, Two Screen Edit Mode, and Full Unicode Support.  Lots of little features, too – a full breakdown of new features can be found at [the Glyphr Studio Blog](http://www.glyphrstudio.com/blog) or at the [Beta 4 GitHub Release Page](https://github.com/mattlag/Glyphr-Studio/releases/tag/v0.4.0).

## Beta 5 is in the works!
The big work items for Beta 5 have been set - thanks to all the community folks who submitted ideas and feedback!
- *Import & Export SVG Font* importing single outlines in Beta 4 was just a stepping stone for this big goal.
- *Ligatures* 'cuz, you know, fonts have ligatures
- *Kerning* 'cuz, you know, fonts have kerning
- *Deprecated TTX Support* Glyphr Studio has a need for a text-based file format.  TTX seemed promising and powerful, but in the end it has been too hard to debug, and too hard for end users to install.  We are shifting gears to SVG as our somewhat 'native' text file format.

There will also be a smattering of smaller and medium sized features, like Custom Guides (in development now).

As always, there is kind of a running list of feature ideas over at the [Issues List]( https://github.com/mattlag/Glyphr-Studio/issues?labels=&page=1&state=open).

### Project Stuff
New in the Beta 5 timeframe is a 'current_build' folder in the github project.  This should be a somewhat stable-ish build, but it will always be a work in progress.  Maybe once or twice a week this will be updated as chunks of work get done.  If you want totally bleeding edge, try out dev/Glyphr_Studio.html.

## Contributing & Feedback
I'm an interaction designer by trade, and have decided to use Glyphr Studio as a giant crash course in JavaScript and HTML5.  Since this is my first major HTML5/JS app, there are many opportunities for growth & improvement - for both code, and collaborative development styles.

If you’d like to contribute a feature or bug fix, please make sure to search the issue tracker first, your issue may have already been discussed or fixed in master.  After researching, please feel free to fork and send a pull request.
