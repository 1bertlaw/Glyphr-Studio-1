## Contributing

Hi, everyone!
I'm an interaction designer by trade, and have decided to use Glyphr Studio as a giant crash course in JavaScript and HTML5.  Since this is the my first major HTML5/JS app, there are many oppertunties for groath & improvement.  Not only am I learning about JS, but i'm also learning about collaborative development.

If youâ€™d like to contribute a feature or bug fix, please make sure to search the issue tracker first; your issue may have already been discussed or fixed in master.  After researching, please feel free to fork and send a pull request.
