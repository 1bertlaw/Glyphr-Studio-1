		"The main vision of Glyphr Studio is to enable people to easily create and save a font.  The second part of this vision, the saving part, is difficult to do straight from a browser.  There are many exciting projects underway in the open source community that will help to do this in the future... but they are not done yet.<br><br>"+
		"Saving a TTX XML file was a stopgap measure on the road to 'easy saving'.  Glyphr Studio Beta 5 will support exporting a SVG Font.  The good news here is that there are free services online that will convert a SVG Font to any other type of font you want.  This is also a stopgap measure, but it is much easier than installing and running TTX.<br><br>"+
		"As of Beta 4, support for TTX is deprecated â€“ meaning we just barely kept it up and running, but it is not robust or fully tested.  In Beta 5 it will be removed completely and replaced with exporting SVG Fonts.  And, hopefully in a short period of time after Beta 5, we'll have an 'easy save' straight to a font file from your browser.<br><br>"+
