Selecting an icon in the Navigation Bar will update the Panel and the Main Content areas.  The top option in the Navigation Bar displays all the main pages in the Panel, allowing you to navigate around Glyphr Studio.<br><br>Some of the pages have additional Navigation Bar icons - like Attributes, Layers, and Character Selection - that are specific to character editing, or other activities.<br><br>The bottom-most icon in the Navigation Bar is a save icon - it does not actually navigate anywhere, but instead is just an omnipresent shortcut to save your Glyphr Project.  When there are changes that have not been saved, the save icon becomes slightly highlighted, and a diamond icon &#x2756; will be added to the browser title.<br><br><span class='btt'><a href='#top'>back to top</a></span><a name='character_edit_and_linked_shapes_pages'></a><h1>Character Edit and Linked Shapes pages</h1>The Character Edit and Linked Shapes pages have many shape editing controls in common.  Linked Shapes are single outlines that can be inserted into many characters of a font.  Updating the Linked Shape will also update all the Linked Shape instances.  Characters in your font can have many shapes (both linked and not), so there is an added concept of Layers on the Character Edit page.<br><br>Linked Shapes are individual shapes that can be added to many Characters. Any time the Linked Shape is edited, all the Characters that use that Linked Shape are updated. There are many individual letter forms that are shared across characters in a single font - for example the round o form of the letters b,d,g,o,p,q. Linked Shapes were designed to make it easy to keep similar letter forms consistent across a font.<br><br>Creating new Linked Shapes, and adding a Linked Shape to a character can be done through the Actions list in the Attributes Panel. The Linked Shapes page is very similar to the Character Edit page. Each Linked Shape is just a single Shape, so there are no shape layers, or add shape buttons. The Linked Shapes page also displays all the shapes that use the current Linked Shape - they are displayed as a thumbnail in the lower left, and update as the Linked Shape is edited. Clicking on one of these thumbnails will navigate to the Character Edit page for that character.<br><br><span class='btt'><a href='#top'>back to top</a></span><a name='shape_editing'></a><h2>Shape Editing</h2>Shape editing concepts can be found on the Character Edit and Linked Shape pages.  Shape and Path attributes, along with metadata, can be edited either in the Attributes Panel, or interactively using the Edit Canvas in the Content Area.<br><br>Many of these attributes can be locked by selecting the small lock icon to the left of the attribute.  This will stop this attribute from accidentally being changed, and in most cases, will limit what can be done on the Edit Canvas.<br><br>Unless otherwise noted, most attributes are in Em units.<br><br><span class='btt'><a href='#top'>back to top</a></span><a name='edit_canvas_tools'></a><h2>Edit Canvas Tools</h2>In the Upper Left hand side of the Edit Canvas there are 12 tools.

Single clicking will create Path Points that do not have handles.  Clicking and dragging will add a Path Point where the click began, and also a symmetrical handle where the click ends.  To stop adding new Path Points, either click the first Path Point, or click off the Edit Canvas.</li><li>Pan Tool - Moves the canvas up/down/left/right.<br>The Keyboard Shortcut for this tool is the Spacebar.</li><li>Point Select - Selects and edits individual Path Points and Handles. It cannot move or resize shapes.</li><li>Shape Select - Selects, moves, and resizes shapes.

Similarly, there are buttons that will populate the upper textbox with certain character sets.The Options area lets you change how your font is drawn to the lower box, including options for Font Size, Line Spacing, and Character Spacing.The 'Generate PNG File' button will launch a new tab with an image of whatever is displayed in the lower box. Right-click the image to save the PNG file.<br><br><span class='btt'><a href='#top'>back to top</a></span><a name='font_settings_page'></a><h1>Font Settings Page</h1><b>Font Settings</b> deal with global attributes that affect all characters in your font.  Glyphr Studio uses the properties in the Font Settings section to display and edit shapes:<ul><li>Character Proportions - Characters have a total height of 1000 Units, called Em Units.  The baseline of that character splits the upper and lower portions of the character vertically.  Input an Ascent Height, and the Descent Height will be calculated automatically.</li><li>Default Left Side Bearing - All characters have a small amount of space to their left that separates them from another character to their left.  Individual Left Side Bearings can be edited in the Attributes Panel of that character.  But, to make things easier, if a specific Left Side Bearing is not set, this Default Left Side Bearing will be applied.</li><li>Line Gap - This is the space between the bottom of the Em square of one line, and the top of the Em square of characters on a line underneath.</li></ul><b>Character Ranges</b> allow you to specify which characters you would like to include in this font.  By default, Basic Latin is included.  Three other extended sets are available by checking the checkbox.  Or, you can add a custom range of characters.<br><br><b>Open Type Properties</b> are a set of font metadata that is saved with the font file.  They include things like Font Name, Version Number, and other descriptive information.  Some of this information was auto-populated when the Glyphr Project was first created.<br><br><span class='btt'><a href='#top'>back to top</a></span><a name='project_settings_page'></a><h1>Project Settings Page</h1>This information does not necessarily have a direct effect on the Font itself, but is used to help with designing your font.  This information is saved when a Glyphr Project is saved, and will be imported when a saved project is loaded.  Viewing the Grids and Guides can be toggled from the Actions section of the Attribute Panel.<ul><li>Project Name - Initially, this project name is used as the Font Name as well.  But, the Glyphr Project can have a different name from the Font itself, which can be edited here.</li><li>Grid System - This can be helpful in visualizing shape dimensions, it draws a light gray grid across the Edit Canvas.  Input a number of divisions per Em.</li><li>X Height - another main dividing line within a character is the 'x height'.  It is a shorthand way of describing the average height of lowercase letters in a font.</li><li>Overshoot - Usually rounded shapes extend a small amount past guide lines, so rounded shapes visually appear to line up with squared shapes.  This will draw a light overshoot guideline past the Cap Height, X Height, and Baseline guidelines.</li><li>UI Behavior - these are user interface settings that you can adjust to your preference.</li></ul><br><span class='btt'><a href='#top'>back to top</a></span><a name=''></a><h1>Open Project Page</h1>There are two options for opening a new Glyphr Project: loading a previously-saved Glyphr Project file, or starting a new font from scratch. To load an existing Glyphr Project file, drag and drop the file onto the area indicated. To start a new project from scratch, edit the Project Name. The Font Name can be edited at any time from the Font Settings page.Loading or starting a new Glyphr Project will delete the current Glyphr Project, so be sure to save your existing project before loading or starting a new one.<br><br><span class='btt'><a href='#top'>back to top</a></span><a name='import_svg_page'></a><h1>Import SVG Page</h1><h2>Importing</h2>There are many pieces of design software that allow you to create SVG outlines.  For example, Adobe Illustrator, or its open-source equivalent Inkscape.  However you create the vector outlines of your characters, you can import them via SVG on this page.  Importing happens one character at a time, and  could be accomplished thusly:<ol style='margin-left:20px;'><li>Select a character in the selection pane on the left.  This will be the destination for your imported outlines.  </li><li>Choose scaling and moving options.  Many times your design software coordinate system setup won't match Glyphr Studio's coordinate system.  Enter the specific height metrics for this character (Does it go above the x-height line, or below the baseline?  Is it a rounded character that has overshoot?) then select Scale and Move options.  Your character outlines will be re-sized and moved to the correct location.</li><li>If your file is a single character, you can drag and drop it onto the area specified.  Otherwise, copy and paste the SVG code into the code box.  The importing will not happen until the Import SVG button is pressed, so you can double-check your code before you proceed.</li><li>Pressing the Import SVG button will parse the SVG code, translate it into Glyphr Studio shapes and paths, and insert it into the specified character.  There is also a button to jump to the Character Edit page for the selected character, and a button to clear the code box.</li></ol><h2>Notes about SVG</h2>SVG is a huge language that is capable of defining a much larger set of graphic design concepts than are needed for font glyph design.  As a result, Glyphr Studio ignores much of the SVG code that gets imported.<br><br><b>What Glyphr Studio imports:</b><ul><li>Outline data from the following tags: path, rect, polygon, polyline, circle, and ellipse.</li><li>The following commands from the 'd' attribute in the path tag: Move To (Mm), Line To (Ll), Horizontal Line To (Hh), Vertical Line To (Vv), Bezier Line To (Cc), Smooth Bezier Line To (Ss), Close Path (Zz).</li></ul><b>What Glyphr Studio ignores:</b><ul><li>The 'line' tag.  And, basically any tag not mentioned in the previous section.</li><li>All stroke attributes, like stroke-width.  Paths are assumed to be outlines of shapes.</li><li>The Arc To (Aa), Quadratic Bezier Line To (Qq), and Smooth Quadratic Bezier Line To (Tt) path commands in the 'd' attribute</li><li>The 'g' tag, and all its attributes.  Any transformations are ignored.</li><li>The 'svg' tag itself.  ViewBox, x, y, width, height attributes are all ignored.</li></ul><b>Things to keep in mind:</b><ul><li>All lines or paths will be closed by Glyphr Studio.  AKA: the last point in any path will be connected with the first point.</li><li>Path direction (or 'winding') is not important in SVG, but it is important in glyph design.  Winding determines if two overlapping shapes both appear filled, or if one 'cuts out' from the other.  This can be toggled in the Shape Attributes Panel with the 'overlap mode' attribute.</li><li>Adobe Illustrator artboards don't get exported to SVG.  If you're importing from Illustrator, and not using the Scale option in Glyphr Studio, then imported shapes may end up in a surprising location.</li><li>Some rectangles that have been rotated in Adobe Illustrator export as SVG rectangles with a transform applied (which Glyphr Studio ignores).  You can remedy this by right-clicking the rotated rectangle in Illustrator, and selecting “Make Compound Path”.</li></ul><br><span class='btt'><a href='#top'>back to top</a></span><a name='export_font_page'></a><h1>Export Font Page</h1>This page has information about TTX, a program used to turn font files into XML, and XML files back into fonts.  Glyphr uses TTX as an intermediary step to create a font file.  Glyphr will generate a TTX XML file for you, which you can then use to generate an OpenType font file.<br><br>More information can be found at <a href='http://www.glyphrstudio.com/ttx/' target=_new>glyphrstudio.com/ttx</a><h2>TTX support has been deprecated</h2>The main vision of Glyphr Studio is to enable people to easily create and save a font.  The second part of this vision, the saving part, is difficult to do straight from a browser.  There are many exciting projects underway in the open source community that will help to do this in the future... but they are not done yet.<br><br>Saving a TTX XML file was a stopgap measure on the road to 'easy saving'.  Glyphr Studio Beta 5 will support exporting a SVG Font.  The good news here is that there are free services online that will convert a SVG Font to any other type of font you want.  This is also a stopgap measure, but it is much easier than installing and running TTX.<br><br>As of Beta 4, support for TTX is deprecated - meaning we just barely kept it up and running, but it is not robust or fully tested.  In Beta 5 it will be removed completely and replaced with exporting SVG Fonts.  And, hopefully in a short period of time after Beta 5, we'll have an 'easy save' straight to a font file from your browser.<br><br><span class='btt'><a href='#top'>back to top</a></span><a name='about_page'></a><h1>About Page</h1>Displays various information about the currently loaded Glyphr Project, and the current Glyphr Studio being used.
